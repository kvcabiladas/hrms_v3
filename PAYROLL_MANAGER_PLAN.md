# Payroll Manager Role Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a dedicated role and dashboard for users with "Payroll Manager" designation.

## Implementation Approach

Given the scope of this feature, I recommend starting with **Phase 1** to get the basic structure working, then we can incrementally add features.

### Quick Start: Phase 1 - Role Detection & Menu

I'll implement the Payroll Manager menu structure now by:
1. Checking if user's designation is "Payroll Manager"
2. Showing appropriate menu items
3. Setting up basic routing

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the basic Payroll Manager dashboard and menu structure now?
