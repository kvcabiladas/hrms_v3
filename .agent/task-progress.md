## 🔄 REMAINING TASKS (Prioritized)

Due to the extensive nature of your requirements (40+ tasks), I'm implementing them systematically. Here's the status:

### HIGH PRIORITY (Next Batch)
1. Complete sidebar updates for all roles
2. Floating toast notifications (upper-right)
3. Address input as textarea (non-resizable)
4. Modal exit confirmation
5. Case-insensitive login

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
6. HR Dashboard fixes (cards, pending leaves UI, recruitment chart)
7. Employee management tabs (List, Attendance, Departments, Jobs)
8. Leave recall UI (Figma design)
9. Remove Employee Attendance from sidebar
10. Search bar functionality

### LOWER PRIORITY (Complex Features)
11. Notifications system (database + UI)
12. Chart.js local installation
13. PDF payslip generation
14. Employee profile tabs (Personal, Financial, Emergency, Picture upload)
15. Department & Job CRUD
16. Export functionality (CSV/Excel)

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

The system is very large with many interconnected components. To ensure quality and avoid breaking changes, I'm implementing in phases:

**Phase 1:** UI/Navigation fixes (in progress)
**Phase 2:** Dashboard & Module improvements
**Phase 3:** Advanced features (notifications, PDF, etc.)

## ⚠️ TOKEN LIMIT CONSIDERATION

Given the conversation length, I recommend:
1. Testing current changes
2. Reporting any issues
3. Continuing with next batch in a fresh conversation if needed

This ensures we maintain code quality and can address any issues that arise.
